Hey there! I'm Alaskan. I'm not _really_ Alaskan, but I am... Alaskan. By name, I'm a fraud, but I really really like this name, and I'm in too deep with it, so I really can't part ways with it at this point.

On this blog, you'll find random posts that are mostly interesting to me. I'm not even really quite sure why I've created this, but I had a feeling I should.

Ultimately, I'd like something of mine to exist on the web indefinitely. I don't use social media much (at least publicly), but maybe if [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) can index my site, a part of me will live on forever through an internet archive. This sounds good enough to me.

Enjoy whatever it is you find here.
